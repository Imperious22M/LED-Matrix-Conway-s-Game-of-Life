This is a small implementation of Conway's Game of Life that is displayed on
a 32x64 LED matrix and runs on a Raspberry Pi Pico.

To run it, download it, open it in Platform IO and upload it. If 
this is the first time you are running a Platform IO project on the
Raspberry Pi Pico, manually upload the UF2 file to the drive of the
Pico in BOOTLOADER mode. If you have already done this before, the 
upload functionality in PlatformIO should work.
